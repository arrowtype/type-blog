# An Intro to FontTools

This post is in preparation for a talk at the 2020 Typographics TypeLab.

## What is FontTools?

## Editing Font Data

## Subsetting a Font

## Instancing a Variable Font




------------------------------------------------------------------

## Please do these two things:

1. Check out https://arrowtype.github.io/vf-slnt-test/slnt-ital-tests/index.html, scroll to the bottom, and follow links to the Chromium & WebKit issues to voice your support for the prioritization of fixing the rendering of slnt & ital variable axes.

2. Check out https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/1994 & let me know if you have experienced the same font-menu issue in other fonts or if you know a solution (but this is probably a macOS issue, so at the very least it would be good to show that many people are having trouble here)
