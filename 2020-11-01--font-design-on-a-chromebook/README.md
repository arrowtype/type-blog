# Setting up FontForge on a Chromebook with ChromeOS and Linux (beta)

You might think you have to spend a lot of money on a power Mac computer & software like Glyphs or RoboFont to get started in type design. While these things are very nice, itâ€™s not actually a requirement. You can instead get a Chromebook for about $150 to $250, then use open-source software like FontForge.

## Set up Linux (beta)

Not all Chromebooks will be able to run Linux out of the box, so check out the [ChromeOS Linux instructions](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en) & [supported devices](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-linux) before buying a Chromebook, if this is a thing you are seriously considering doing.

## Install Flatpak

Note: to copy on a Chromebook, use Control+C. To paste in the terminal, you must use Control+V, *then* right click on the terminal.

First, follow the instructions to install Flatpak:
https://flatpak.org/setup/Chrome%20OS/

Note: you must also add `sudo` for step 4 to work:


    sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo


## Install FontForge

Then, install [FontForge](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.fontforge.FontForge):


    sudo flatpak install flathub org.fontforge.FontForge

Note: If you run without the `sudo`, you might get an error like this:


    stephen@penguin:~$ flatpak run org.fontforge.FontForge
    error: app/org.fontforge.FontForge/x86_64/master not installed


## Off to the races!

For tips & resources on getting started in type design generally, check out my blog post [**Getting started in Type Design (and possible next steps)**](https://arrowtype.github.io/type-blog/2020-05-01--getting-started-in-type/). This does skew towards Mac & RoboFont (my main setup), but also includes some good information that is about type design & development not tied to any particularly OS or software.
