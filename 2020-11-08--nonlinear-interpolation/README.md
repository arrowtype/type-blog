Ever since [Underware Type started exploring HOI](https://underware.nl/case-studies/hoi/), I’ve amazed by the tech & possibilities, and I’ve wanted to try it myself.

For a long time, I didn’t get it. Then, I started to understand it, but felt like actually making it work would be nearly impossible (or super inefficient, at best). But, I’ve taken another look and got a functional test working, so I’ve documented & shared my findings. 

TL;DR: Using a slightly-simplified “quadratic” approach, NLI now feels much more within reach – but maybe the results of the “cubic” approach are so much better, the hassle is worth it.

I’ve made some tests sources, a web demo, and a written explanation (links above).

Hopefully this helps someone else understand NLI a little better, too!
